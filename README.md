Using News to Predict Stock Movements

LogisticRegression.py contains the base model adapted from a CS124 assignment where students trained and used a NLP model to conduct sentiment analysis. 

Directory 'data' contains information collected from the Kaggle repository 'Using News to Predict Stock Movements,' which consists of news headlines sourced from Reddit and DJIA prices from Yahoo Finance.
The file LogisticRegressionTF.py attempts to use tensorflow to implement logistic regression, but it currently doesn't work. As of February 5, 2019, it is borrowed almost entirely from ayermericdamien's Tensorflow Examples on Github.
